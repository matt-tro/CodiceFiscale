# CodiceFiscale

This project, based on famous repository https://github.com/lucavandro/CodiceFiscaleJS, takes into account regional law No. 2/2016 following a referendum which has abolished the provinces of Carbonia-Iglesias, Ogliastra, Olbia-Tempio and Medio Campidano.

Furthermore, the provinces of Sardinia have been updated with the relevant municipalities. The provinces now are: Nuoro, Oristano, Sassari, Sud Sardegna and Citt√† Metropolinata di Cagliari.
